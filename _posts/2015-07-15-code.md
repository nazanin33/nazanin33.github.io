Practice with Python program examples is always a good choice to scale up your logical understanding and programming skills.

Here we will use recursion function. The code defines a function Fibonacci(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively. It checks for invalid input and returns the Fibonacci number based on the base cases (0 and 1) or by recursively calling itself with reduced values of n. The driver program prints the 10th Fibonacci number.

```python

def Fibonacci(n):
    if n<= 0:
        print("Incorrect input")
    # First Fibonacci number is 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    # Second Fibonacci number is 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2)

```
