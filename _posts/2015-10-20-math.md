This equation is one of the most famous equations in physics, formulated by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity. It describes the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m) and the relationship between them when an object is at rest. The equation states that the energy of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. 


 $$ E = mc^2 $$

This equation revolutionized our understanding of the physical world by revealing the interconnectedness between matter and energy. It suggests that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa, as demonstrated in nuclear reactions and the creation of atomic bombs. The speed of light, which is a constant in the equation, is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second and serves as a fundamental limit for the velocity of anything in the universe.
